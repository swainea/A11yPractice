# Udacity Web Accessibility

Hi there! This is the course repo for Udacity Web Accessibility. Contained in
this repo are a number of sample exercises to help you improve your
accessibility skills.

## Important note ðŸš¨

The exercises in this repo are for you to complete on your own time. You do not need to send pull requests to this repo when you complete an exercise. Instead, take a look at the next video in the Udacity course where the solution will be shown and compare that to your answer. Sorry for any confusion! ðŸ˜‡

## Running the examples

Most of the examples can just have their `index.html` dragged into the browser
in order to run. Some examples may require running a local server, an easy
way to run a local server is with [the Web Server for Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en). If you need to run a local server for an example we'll
be sure to note this requirement in the example's README as well as in the
course instructor notes.

## Found a bug?

Please feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/udacity/ud891/issues/new)
if you find anything wrong with the exercises.
